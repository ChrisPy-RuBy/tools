A silly tool that I use to keep notes on things

Dumps the string if it has a valid tag to a file somewhere secret. 
Hilariously it also shells out and fires the todo off to the 
"Things" app where I try to keep track of this sort of thing.
Why is it written in C, I thought it would be fun, I was wrong...

If you are running this on a new machine make sure you have the 
super secret password set.
